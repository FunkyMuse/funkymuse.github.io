 One essential aspect of many applications is persistent data storage and SQLDelight is a popular library for managing database interactions in Kotlin projects. 
 
 In this blog post, we'll walk through the process of integrating SQLDelight into a KMP project, enabling you to efficiently manage your database interactions across various platforms (Android, iOS, Desktop).


## What is SQLDelight?

[SQLDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) is a Kotlin library that generates typesafe Kotlin APIs from your SQL statements, enabling you to write database queries in SQL and access them through generated Kotlin code. 

This approach provides compile-time safety and ensures that your database interactions are efficient and error-free.


## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
1. Kotlin Multiplatform project set up.
2. Basic understanding of SQL.
3. (Optional) Install the [SQLDelight IDE plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8191-sqldelight)

## Step1: Add SQLDelight to your project

First and foremost, add the verion in your `libs.versions.toml` script.

```toml
[versions]
sqldelight = "2.0.1"

[libraries]
sqldelight-android = { module = "app.cash.sqldelight:android-driver", version.ref = "sqldelight" }
sqldelight-ios = { module = "app.cash.sqldelight:native-driver", version.ref = "sqldelight" }
sqldelight-desktop = { module = "app.cash.sqldelight:sqlite-driver", version.ref = "sqldelight" }
sqldelight-coroutines = { module = "app.cash.sqldelight:coroutines-extensions", version.ref = "sqldelight" }

[plugins]
sqldelight = { id = "app.cash.sqldelight", version.ref = "sqldelight" }
```

Open your project's `build.gradle.kts` and add the plugin
```kotlin
plugins {
    ....
    alias(libs.plugins.sqldelight) apply false
}
```

Then in your `:shared` module or *wherever you'd host your database*, apply the plugin.

```kotlin
plugins {
    ....
    alias(libs.plugins.sqldelight)
}
```

In the same module's `build.gradle.kts` you can configure the package name where the database will be created and as well as the database's name.

```kotlin
sqldelight {
    databases {
        create("Database") {
            packageName = "dev.funkymuse.myapp.shared.database"
        }
    }
}
```

and add the driver's platform specific implementations

```kotlin
 sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                ....
                implementation(libs.sqldelight.coroutines)
            }
        }

        androidMain {
            dependencies {    
                ....        
                implementation(libs.sqldelight.android)
            }
        }
        jvmMain { //or desktop main
            dependencies {
                ....
                implementation(libs.sqldelight.desktop)
            }
        }
        iosMain {
            dependencies {
                ....
                implementation(libs.sqldelight.ios)
            }
        }
    }
```

## Step 2: Define Your Database Schema

Create a `.sq` file where you define your database schema using SQL. 

For example, let's create a `favorite_movies.sq` file, that file should be located in the root folder of your module, i.e if you are creating your database in `commonMain` of your `:shared` module, the folder structure should be `shared\src\commonMain\sqldelight\dev.funkymuse.myapp.shared.database` where you append your package name.

It should look like this <img src="/assets/img/sql_delight/package_structure.png" alt = "package structure" class="center" >

The `.sq` file contains the following:
```sql
---TABLE
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `favorite_movies`(
    `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    `rating` REAL,
    `title` TEXT NOT NULL,
    `year` INTEGER,
    `poster` TEXT
);

---INDICES
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS favorite_movies_id_title_idxs ON `favorite_movies` (`id`,`title`);


--QUERIES
entries:
SELECT * FROM `favorite_movies` ORDER BY year DESC;

getById:
SELECT * FROM `favorite_movies` WHERE id = :id LIMIT 1;

deleteWithIds:
DELETE FROM `favorite_movies` WHERE id IN ?;

deleteWithId:
DELETE FROM `favorite_movies` WHERE id = :id;

deleteAll:
DELETE FROM `favorite_movies`;

insert:
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO `favorite_movies` (
    `id`,
    `rating`,
    `title`,
    `year`,
    `poster`
) VALUES (
    :id,
    :rating,
    :title,
    :year,
    :poster
);
```

## Step 3: Create platform specific SQL driver

Expect classes are in beta as for writing this article, you can enable them by:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    targets.configureEach {
        compilations.configureEach {
            compilerOptions.configure {
                freeCompilerArgs.add("-Xexpect-actual-classes")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Inside your `:commonMain` create a `DatabaseDriver.kt`

```kotlin
expect class DatabaseDriver {
    fun createDriver(): SqlDriver
}
const val DB_NAME = "test.db"
```

Inside `:androidMain` create a `DatabaseDriver.android.kt`

#1. You can do it either by injecting the context as a constructor, [more info here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-ktor-sqldelight.html#create-platform-database-drivers). 

```kotlin
actual class DatabaseDriver(private val context: Context) {
    actual fun createDriver(): SqlDriver = AndroidSqliteDriver(
        schema = Database.Schema,
        context = context,
        name = DB_NAME
    )
}
```

#2. You can read my [previous article](/posts/create-data-store-kmp/#library-setup) where I share an already known trick, which is my preferred way of doing this, let's keep it this way.

```kotlin
actual class DatabaseDriver {
    actual fun createDriver(): SqlDriver  = AndroidSqliteDriver(Database.Schema, applicationContext, DB_NAME)
}
```

Inside `:iosMain` create a `DatabaseDriver.ios.kt`

```kotlin
actual class DatabaseDriver {
    actual fun createDriver(): SqlDriver = NativeSqliteDriver(
        schema = Database.Schema,
        name = DB_NAME
    )
}
```

Inside `:jvmMain`/`:desktopMain` create a `DatabaseDriver.jvm.kt`

```kotlin
actual class DatabaseDriver {
    actual fun createDriver(): SqlDriver {
        val isDebug = true// or you can use BuildKonfig.isDebug to setup your logic
        val parentFolder = if (isDebug) {
            File(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"))
        } else {
            File(System.getProperty("user.home") + "/MyFancyApp")
        }
        if (!parentFolder.exists()) {
            parentFolder.mkdirs()
        }
        val databasePath = if (isDebug) {
            File(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), DB_NAME)
        } else {
            File(parentFolder, DB_NAME)
        }
        return JdbcSqliteDriver(url = "jdbc:sqlite:${databasePath.absolutePath}").also { driver ->
            Database.Schema.create(driver = driver)
        }
    }

}
```
The reason we're passing the file to the driver is that we want to store the database somewhere. 
In this example, it's shown that in `release` mode, it would be placed in the user's home folder under the app's name as a subfolder. 
Otherwise, 'debug' mode puts it in the `java temp dir` which is useful for short-term debugging.

You can also use `JdbcSqliteDriver.IN_MEMORY` but for the sake of persistence, let's keep it this way.

**Keep in mind that obtaining/creating the file of the database is an I/O operation and should be offloaded to an I/O thread. This is just an example and not directly copy-pasteable code**.


## Step 3: Use your typesafe Database

**You can force create the database interface by running**
```shell
./gradlew :shared:generateCommonMainDatabaseInterface
```

Now, we have a database which we can instantiate, by doing `val database = Database(DatabaseDriver().createDriver())`, you can read my [previous article](/posts/create-data-store-kmp/#initialization) where to initialize it.

Every `.sq` file gets it's own class that you can use to query the database, in this example we can access it via `database.favorite_moviesQueries`

Let's create a helper model for our database query.

```kotlin
data class FavoriteModel(
    val id: Long,
    val title: String,
    val rating: Double?,
    val poster: String?,
    val year : Long
)
```

A data source

```kotlin
interface FavoriteMoviesLocalDataSource {
    val favoriteMovies : Flow<List<FavoriteModel>>
    suspend fun deleteFavoriteMovies(ids: List<Long>)
    suspend fun deleteWithId(id: Long)
    suspend fun insert(
        id: Long,
        rating: Double?,
        title: String,
        year: Long?,
        poster: String?
    )
}
```

and implement it

```kotlin
internal class FavoriteMoviesLocalDataSourceImpl internal constructor(
    private val favoriteMoviesQueries: Favorite_moviesQueries,
    private val ioDispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher = Dispatchers.IO
) : FavoriteMoviesLocalDataSource {

    override val favoriteMovies: Flow<List<FavoriteModel>> =
        favoriteMoviesQueries.entries(mapper = { id, rating, title, year, poster ->
            FavoriteModel(
                id = id,
                title = title,
                poster = poster,
                rating = rating,
                year = year
            )
        }).asFlow()
            .mapToList(ioDispatcher)

    override suspend fun deleteFavoriteMovies(ids: List<Long>) = withContext(ioDispatcher) {
        favoriteMoviesQueries.deleteWithIds(ids)
    }

    override suspend fun deleteWithId(id: Long) = withContext(ioDispatcher) {
        favoriteMoviesQueries.deleteWithId(id)
    }

    override suspend fun insert(
        id: Long,
        rating: Double?,
        title: String,
        year: Long?,
        poster: String?,
    ) = withContext(ioDispatcher) {
        favoriteMoviesQueries.insert(
            id = id,
            rating = rating,
            title = title,
            poster = poster,
            year = year
        )
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Integrating SQLDelight into your Kotlin Multiplatform project allows you to manage database interactions efficiently across different platforms. 

By leveraging the power of SQL and Kotlin, you can ensure type safety and reliability in your database operations. 

Room doesn't have KMP support yet, but they're on their way. I'm excited to see what they'll bring to the table too.

I miss batch insert support for SQLDelight out of the box which forces you to kinda use `queries.transaction { }` and splitting the original list.

Since doing backend work, I've found SQLDelight to be a more natural way of expressing everything in a pure SQL manner, where Room does more for you with the help of KSP.

Until next article.
