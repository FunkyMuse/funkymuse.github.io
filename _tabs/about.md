Hello there stranger,<br/>
I go on the internet as FunkyMuse, 

Funky as lively,

Muse as a person or personified force who is the source of inspiration for a creative individual (you?).

I develop Android apps natively in Kotlin, eagerly trying new spices of food and writing poems whenever my mind wanders, passionate about music concerts,
getting in touch with different cultures of humanity and software engineering.

That's me, what about you?

Don't forget to say hello!
